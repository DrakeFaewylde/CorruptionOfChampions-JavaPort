TODOs
-----

 * Piercings.
 * Add an `InventoryFullScene.java` file for when you try to pick up an item, while also having a full inventory.
 * Implement followers', lovers', slaves' variables in subclasses. Look at `ActorRathazul.java` for example.
 * Implement location discovery.
 * Do gills actually exist? I see some references in the original sources, but I've never had them in-game.
